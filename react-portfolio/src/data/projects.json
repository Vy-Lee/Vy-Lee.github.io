          "This Monochromatic series is an effort to retain the internal beauty and magnanimity of usual objects and settings in the simplicity and subtle charm of colors.",
          "The pictures dwell mostly on neutral colors, mainly on earth colors and soft contrasting shades, so the tones would be calm and filled with silence and introspection.",
          "For instance, the photo of the peanuts and sardines is one that conveys a sense of frozen domestic life, in which food and routine loom larger, almost zen-like, when cast in monochromatic terms.",
          "Similarly, the photo of the mirror, with its expanding grid of mirrors, is one that carries the sense of infinite reflection, symbolic of the manner in which even such common, everyday items can cause one to ponder ideas regarding perception and identity.",
          "By reducing the color to one universal palette, these photos invite the audience to focus    more on form, texture, and shape, allowing them to become familiar with the objects' position in our world and the emotions behind them that they might trigger."

        "That daylight exists and that these are candid shots gives the viewer the permission to celebrate the mundane, and often uncelebrated, work of these workers and raises the humdrum to stories of duty and service."

        "For my final project, I wanted to explore how nature and personal healing interact.",
        "I had played with how the subtle unfolding of spring can mirror the emotional and intellectual struggles many experience, and how nature can bring a sense of calm and renewal.",
        "The project starts with images that show the weight of mental illness, like pills spilling out of a bottle into a hand, and words 'I'm dying' written on someone's face. These images show the inner struggle and set the stage for what is to follow.",
        "As the project goes on, the tone shifts to a more positive one to show the healing potential of nature.",
        "In one image, a person walks barefoot in a stream, and in another, flowers are being shoved into their hair. These are the scenes of the peace that comes with embracing the rhythms of nature.",
        "The sun passing through leaves and the easy movement of the subject give a feeling of letting go and finding peace.",
        "The further we go in the essay, the more the topic is seen reclining in nature, finally relaxed among the lush greens of the forest.",
        "The final photographs in the essay capture the subject lying on the forest floor, peaceful and smiling, summarizing the time of healing and peace after a moment of conflict.",
        "The essay ends with the subject standing next to a tree, representing the unity and harmony seen between trees.",
        "Through showing these photographs, I aimed to prove that healing is not simple, but in nature, there is a place to do things slowly, think, and feel at ease."
